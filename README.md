# dotfiles

These are just my Linux dotfiles which I am using at home and at work with focus
on Administration / DevOps / SRE. Managed with
[Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). Feel free to use or get inspired,
just be careful and know what the fuck you do.

## Install

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flokoe/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- comma,seperated,tags
```

## Usage

```bash
just install
```

There are many awesome dotfile repositories, but here are those which inspired me or where I stole ideas and functionality from.
