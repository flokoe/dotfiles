# Florian's dotfiles
These are just my personal dotfiles which I am using at work and on my personal machines.  
The dotfiles are used on Linux especially Debian, but they should work on most other Operating Systems. Nevertheless be carefull.  
If you have any tips, tricks or suggestions I would appreciate them.  
Now feel free to explore, learn and/or use it for your own dotfiles. Enjoy :)
